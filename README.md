# r_joke_generator

## **Random Joke Generator**
This is a simple Python program that generates random jokes by fetching data from an API. Each time the program is executed, it retrieves a joke from the API and displays it on the screen.

## Features:
- Fetches a random joke from the [Official Joke API](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/)
- Combines the setup and punchline of the joke
- Displays the generated joke on the command line
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- The `requests` and `questionary` libraries
## Installation
- Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Install the requests library by running the following command:
```pip install requests```, ```pip install questionary```
## Usage
- Clone the repository or download the random_joke.py file.
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the random_joke.py file is located.
- Run the following command to execute the program:
```python random_joke.py```
- The program will prompt you to select a joke category from a dropdown list.
- Once you choose a category, a random joke from that category will be displayed on the command line.
- You can run the program multiple times to get different jokes from the chosen category.

**Feel free to modify the program or add your own jokes to the code!**

Note: Make sure you are connected to the internet while running the program to fetch jokes from the API.
